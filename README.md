# Trajectory_panner_DE
This work first classfies between finger-, elbow- and shoulder-movement (motor execution not imagery) along with left and right motor execution to move a simulated robot arm in 3D space towards a target of known location using an energy optimal differential evolution based trajectory planner. This work was published in Bhattacharyya et al, BSPC, 2014. An example dataset is also included.
